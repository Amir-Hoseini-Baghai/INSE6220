### Data set information 
The Wine dataset  contains results from a chemical analysis of wines grown in Italy from three different cultivars. It features data on 13 chemical constituents from 178 instances of wine. This dataset is utilized primarily for classification tasks, with attributes including alcohol, malic acid, ash, and others related to wine's physical and chemical properties. The dataset's well-defined class structures make it suitable for testing new classifiers, although it's not considered highly challenging.

### What is the goal?
The goal of this project is to apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and machine learning classification algorithms, specifically Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Naive Bayes (NB) to a dataset of wine chemical profiles. By employing PCA, the project aims to reduce the dataset's dimensionality, enhancing the clarity and efficiency of the classification models used to distinguish between different wine cultivars. The ultimate objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in accurately classifying wines based on their chemical attributes, which can aid in quality assessment, product differentiation, and enhancing consumer satisfaction within the wine industry.
### Tools and Techniques
the key tools and techniques utilized include Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, and machine learning algorithms like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Naive Bayes (NB)  for classification. The PyCaret library, a machine learning tool in Python, was employed to facilitate model training, tuning, evaluation, and comparison. Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, decision boundary visualization, and performance evaluation through confusion matrices and ROC curves were also integral to the analysis.
